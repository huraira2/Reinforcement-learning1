# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

A multi-agent reinforcement learning environment where multiple agents learn to cooperate or compete.

## Overview

This project introduces concepts like independent learning, centralized training with decentralized execution, and communication between agents. Demonstrates how RL extends to complex multi-agent scenarios.

## Features

- Multi-agent environment implementation
- Independent learning agents
- Cooperative and competitive scenarios
- Agent communication mechanisms
- Performance analysis in multi-agent settings

## Running the Project

```bash
cd 10_multi_agent_rl
pip install torch gym numpy
python multi_agent_rl.py
```

## Key Concepts

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Multiple learning agents
- **Cooperation vs Competition**: Different interaction modes
- **Independent Learning**: Separate agent policies
- **Communication**: Information sharing between agents

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Custom multi-agent environment
