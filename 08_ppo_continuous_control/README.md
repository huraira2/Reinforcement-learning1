# PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) Continuous Control

Implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization for continuous control tasks.

## Overview

PPO is a state-of-the-art policy gradient method that maintains a balance between sample efficiency and implementation simplicity. This project shows how to handle continuous action spaces and implement clipped surrogate objectives.

## Features

- PPO algorithm implementation
- Continuous action space handling
- Clipped surrogate objective
- Advantage estimation with GAE
- Actor-Critic architecture for continuous control

## Running the Project

```bash
cd 08_ppo_continuous_control
pip install torch gym
python ppo_continuous_control.py
```
